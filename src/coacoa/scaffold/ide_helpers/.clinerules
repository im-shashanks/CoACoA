# CoaCoA rules for Cline

- Always read `.coacoa/coacoa.yaml` for configuration values before acting.
- Commands map 1:1 with agents. Example:
  - `/analyze-codebase` → use `.coacoa/agents/code_explorer.md`.
  - `/pm new-prd` → use `.coacoa/agents/pm.md` with `.coacoa/templates/prd.md`.
- When a required artefact path in `coacoa.yaml` does not exist, call `/orchestrator fix <artefact>`.

AGENT SELECTION HINTS

- If `.coacoa/context/analysis.md` is **absent**, default to greenfield flows (analyst → pm → architect).
- If present, default to brownfield flows (code-explorer → pm → architect / sm).
